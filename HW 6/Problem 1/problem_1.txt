You have list of Agile story statuses (“Ready”, “In Progress”, “Blocked”,
“Completed”). You would like to store these values in your application and they
will be accessed and searched several times but they won’t be changed. Which
built-in data structure can be used? List or Tuple? And Why? 


Answer:
I would use a tuple in this situation. Tuples are immutable which would help avoid any accidental deletions.
